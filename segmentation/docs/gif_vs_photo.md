# Context
After abandoning our attempt to create a dataset that evokes multiple emotions from the same image (due to the contextual nature of the photos), we are now deciding whether to use the GIF or JPG/PNG format for creating a sequence of photos (or photos side by side) to obtain representational data on the real emotions of people watching the photos.

# Research:

## Gif
Research shows that the GIF format has a limitation of 256 colors, which results in a loss of quality. The transition from one photo to another needs to be either fast without blending in or slow to represent different emotions.

## JPEG/PNG
Both of these formats can save photos. Main diffrence is that JPEG(JPG) formats do save photos with some visual loss while PNG formats save the file raw. Since we are not planing to manipulate with photos in our project, we are free to go either way. 

# Conclusion
Based on our research, we conclude that sequential or parallel photo visualization with JPG/PNG could work better for our project, as GIFs may result in a significant degradation in visual quality.
