# MOCKUP DOCUMENTATION

## Introduction

The website consists of four pages: HomePage, InfoPage, FunctionalPage, and Log in/Register. The purpose of the website is to present the company's functionalities in a clear and easy-to-understand manner for users.

## HomePage 

The HomePage features a navigation menu with links to the other pages, as well as three areas that briefly describe the project and encourage users to use our solution. The bottom of the page contains a footer with basic information and a contact option with the project team.

## InfoPage

InfoPage will contain more detailed information about the services offered by the company and the technologies used. We plan to enhance it with screenshots that showcase our solution.

## FunctionalPage

On the Functional Page, users will find a gallery of photos that evoke various emotions. The page also features an image from a sensor that allows for real-time detection of emotions. Information about the detected emotion will be displayed in a dedicated space. Additionally, users will be able to switch photos using a button located on the page.

## Log in/Register

On the Log in/Register page, users have the option to create an account or log in. During registration, only the most basic information about the user will be collected.
