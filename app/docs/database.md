- **Flexibility**: MongoDB's flexible document model allows developers to store data in a way that makes sense for their specific use case. This is particularly useful when dealing with 
- **Performance**: MongoDB is designed to provide high performance and low latency, making it a good choice for applications that require fast access to data.
