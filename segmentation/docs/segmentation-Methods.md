# IMAGE SEGMENTATION METHODS


1. Edge-based segmentation: Edge-based segmentation techniques involve detecting edges or boundaries in an image and then grouping the pixels along those edges into segments. Popular edge detection algorithms in Python include Canny edge detection and Sobel edge detection.

2. Region-based segmentation: 
 Region-based segmentation techniques involve grouping pixels into regions based on their similarity in color, texture, or other features. Common region-based segmentation algorithms in Python include k-means clustering, mean shift clustering, and watershed segmentation.(for example using vgg16 model with K-means clustering is really effective)

3. Contour-based segmentation: Contour-based segmentation techniques involve finding contours or outlines of objects in an image and then segmenting the image based on those contours. Python provides several contour detection algorithms, including the OpenCV library's findContours() function.

4. Thresholding: Thresholding is a simple image segmentation technique that involves setting all pixels in an image above a certain threshold value to a foreground value and all pixels below the threshold value to a background value. Thresholding is often used for simple object segmentation tasks, such as separating the foreground object from the background.

5. Deep learning-based segmentation: Deep learning-based segmentation techniques involve training a neural network to segment an image. Popular deep learning frameworks in Python include TensorFlow and PyTorch, which provide pre-trained models To train a deep learning-based segmentation model, the training data is first preprocessed and augmented to increase the diversity of the dataset. Common data augmentation techniques include random flips, rotations, and cropping. The model is then trained using a loss function that measures the dissimilarity between the predicted segmentation map and the ground truth segmentation map. Common loss functions used for segmentation include cross-entropy loss, dice loss, and focal loss.

## Models used in deep-learning image segmentation

1. U-Net: U-Net is a convolutional neural network architecture. It is a fully convolutional network that consists of an encoder and a decoder, which are connected by skip connections. U-Net is particularly effective for tasks where the objects are small and have complex shapes.

2. SegNet: SegNet is a fully convolutional neural network architecture that consists of an encoder and a decoder, similar to U-Net. However, in SegNet, the pooling indices from the encoder are stored and used in the decoder to perform upsampling, which reduces the number of parameters and improves memory efficiency. SegNet is particularly effective for tasks where the objects have clear boundaries and are not too small.

3. Mask R-CNN: Mask R-CNN is a region-based convolutional neural network that extends the Faster R-CNN architecture to perform instance segmentation, i.e., segmenting each object instance in an image. Mask R-CNN uses a mask head to generate a binary mask for each detected object instance, in addition to the bounding box coordinates. Mask R-CNN is particularly effective for tasks where there are multiple object instances in the image, and each instance needs to be segmented separately.

4. DeepLab V3+: DeepLab V3+ is a variant of the DeepLab architecture, which is a family of convolutional neural networks for semantic image segmentation. DeepLab V3+ uses atrous convolution, also known as dilated convolution, to capture multi-scale context information without increasing the number of parameters. DeepLab V3+ is particularly effective for tasks where the objects have fine details and textures.

## Popular datasets for learning

1. COCO: The Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset is a large-scale dataset for object detection, segmentation, and captioning tasks. It contains more than 330,000 images with over 2.5 million object instances labeled with pixel-level segmentation annotations. The COCO dataset covers a wide range of object categories, and it is often used for training and evaluating instance segmentation models

2. PASCAL VOC: The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) dataset is a benchmark dataset for object recognition and segmentation tasks. It contains 20 object categories and more than 11,500 images labeled with object bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and object classes. The PASCAL VOC dataset has been used in many computer vision competitions, and it is often used for evaluating segmentation models.

3. ImageNet: The ImageNet dataset is a large-scale dataset for object recognition tasks. It contains over 1.2 million images with 1,000 object categories. Although ImageNet does not have pixel-level segmentation annotations, it is often used for pre-training deep learning models, including segmentation models. Pre-training on ImageNet can improve the performance of segmentation models on downstream tasks.


# SUMMARY

In the end there is no best methods. It is not necsessary to use deep-learning, because methods mentioned earlier can give satisfacting results. Also methods from point 1 to 4 are quite easy to implement, so there should be no problem in implementing them for tests.
Combining these methods with models of image classification can lead to really accurate segmantation.

Deep-learning models that are trained on these big datasets are really accurate, but if they encounter unfamiliar instance it will not give good result.
