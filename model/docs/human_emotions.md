# Context
For the sake of our project we need to establish emotions that we work with. After research and consulations we picked emotion listed above. Emotions were chosen with several criteria, the most important being:

- ease of recognition
- suffecient resources of emotions on the web
- unambiguity of emotion

Below the emotions are listed and briefly described including samples. Descibtion of emotion is based on facial landmarks specified in scientific papers whose references can be found in the [Sources](#sources) category

# Emotions
Human emotions can be recognized with tons of diffrent methods staring with:
- Electroencephalography (EEG)
- Electrocardiography (ECG)
- Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)
- Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

And much, much more. In saying that, we in our project are only going to focus on recognition optainable from camera/facial sensor that we are required to use. These methods although can be used to expand our project even further.
