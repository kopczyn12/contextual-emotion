# About

This is a file describing the project assumptions and individual milestones.

# Assumptions

- **eye-tracking** - using a ready-made solution and modifying it, then trying to implement your own solution
- **detection of the 5 basic emotions (happy, sadness, angry, surprised, disgust)** - detection time 250 ms - 400 ms, accuracy on "best" emotion 65%
- **image segmentation** - on the basis of 40 "thematically similar" images evoking strong emotions
- **web application** - the framework chosen by the team to implement it

# Milestones

**2.** **_09/05/2022_**
- **beta version of the website**
- **beta version of the model**
