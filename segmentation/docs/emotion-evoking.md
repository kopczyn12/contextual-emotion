## Evoking an emotion
The process of evoking a visible emotion in someone through a particular image can be complex, as it depends on a range of factors such as their personality, circumstances, and cultural background. For example, some individuals may react with disgust when viewing an open wound, while others may not be fazed by it due to its familiarity in their profession, such as a surgeon. Nonetheless, there are some fundamental principles to consider when selecting images that can elicit specific emotions.

## The color scheme
The color scheme of an image is one of the critical factors that contribute to its emotional impact on the viewer. The color palette, in particular, can evoke different emotions based on the use of warm and bright colors, like reds and yellows, which can evoke feelings of happiness and excitement, or cooler and darker colors, like blues and grays, which may suggest sadness or melancholy. The use of bright and contrasting colors can create a sense of surprise and energy, while muted and desaturated tones can evoke disgust or distaste.

## Lighting
Similarly, lighting can accentuate emotions by playing with high-key or low-key tones. Low-key lighting, which employs darker tones and shadows, can evoke a sense of mystery, fear, and the unknown. On the other hand, high-key lighting, which uses brighter tones and minimal shadows, can promote feelings of comfort, happiness, and well-being. The right use of lighting on an image can effectively enhance the emotional impact and create a more powerful visual narrative.

## Weather
The weather depicted in a photo can have a significant impact on the emotional response it evokes in the viewer. A bright, sunny day with blue skies can evoke feelings of happiness and contentment, while a dark, rainy day can create a sense of sadness and melancholy. A snowstorm with heavy snowfall can evoke wonder and excitement, while a foggy morning can create a sense of mystery and intrigue. A photo taken during a sunset or sunrise can evoke feelings of warmth, tranquility, and hope, while a lightning storm can create a sense of fear and surprise. Ultimately, the weather depicted in an image can play a significant role in shaping the viewer's emotional response to it.

## Context
Understanding the context surrounding an image can greatly affect the emotions it evokes. This can include knowledge of historical events or situational circumstances. For example, the famous image of Tank Man from Tiananmen Square can evoke a range of emotions even without knowing the context, but knowing the full story adds additional layers of meaning. The same can be said for abstract images, such as the works of Salvador Dali, which can surprise and intrigue viewers even without a clear narrative.

## Reading facial expressions
We have no problem with reading facial expressions and understanding the emotions they convey, such as anger, happiness, sadness, and more. By using our emotional intelligence, we can interpret the feelings of others and may even feel the same way as the subject in a picture. Using facial expressions in images is certainly one way to create emotional impact.

## Personal experience
The emotional response to images is also influenced by personal experience. A photo of a childhood toy may bring back very strong feelings of nostalgia and happiness for one person, but not for others. However, emotions tend to be more universal when they arise from experiences that are widely shared. For example, a picture of a stunning sunset can evoke feelings of warmth and peace in most people, irrespective of their personal experiences.

## Summary
The process of evoking emotions through images is complex and depends on factors such as personality, circumstances, and cultural background. Key factors that contribute to emotional impact include color scheme, lighting, weather, context, and personal experience. The context of an image, such as knowledge of historical events or situational circumstances, can greatly affect the emotions it evokes. Understanding the factors that contribute to emotional impact can help in selecting images that elicit specific emotions. Overall, evoking a specific emotion in a large group of people requires telling a simple, easily readable story and using appropriate color palette and shadows.
