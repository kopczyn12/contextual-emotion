## Context

This document refers  to our CURRENT dataset that have worked on. This images have been heavly reworked in Photoshop including shadows, tonal range, contrast, depth and many other small tweaks. Photos evoking diffrent emotions have been described below (their main attributes- that is objects that we focus on). Images are annotated in VGG image annotator which is released under MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology License), which means we are allowed to use it freely. 

## Happy
In happy class we choosed bright, well light photos whith objects of cats, dogs ,ducks and bunnies.

## Sad
To evoke sad emotions we focused on reducing the colors of the image (often to Gray Scale), and focused on context of the photos. Backgrounds like ruins really built sad mood. Apart from that objects are mostly sad people.

## Suprised 
In suprised category we also focused on a bit dull mood, and tried to scare or suprise receivers with really strange photos, for eg. Deer skulls, free diving.

In regards of evoking angry emotions we focused on enviromental pollution, as it is objectively viewed as wrong.

Current dataset is a huge leap forward comparing it to earlier one. We really hope to stick with it throughout entire project.
